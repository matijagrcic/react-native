- Density Independent Pixels: React Nativeâ€™s pixel unit of measurement
- Flexbox: Make your layouts flexible by default
- Dimensions: Calculate sizes/position based on device dimensions
- Percentages: Dimensions Relative to its container
- PixelRatio: Handle sizing depending on pixel depth

> A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0. If a parent does not have either a fixed width and height or flex, the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the flex children will not be visible.

## Set up an open, closed or internal test

When you create an internal test, you can immediately release your app to your internal testers.
This can help you identify issues and receive feedback earlier in your development process. An internal test is:

- Fast: You can distribute apps via the internal test track much faster than the open or closed tracks. When you publish a new Android App Bundle to the internal test track, it will be available to testers within minutes.
  Note: If you're publishing an app for the first time, it will be immediately available to internal testers, but will have a temporary name and Store Listing information for up to 48 hours.
- Flexible: You can adjust internal tests to support different testing stages, such as quality assurance checks and post-launch debugging.
- Safe: With the internal test track, your test app is distributed to users securely via the Play Store.
